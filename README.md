### Description
What you should learn from this project:

* Who designed and implemented the original Unix operating system? Dennis Ritchie, Doug McIlroy, and Peter G. Neumann also credit Kernighan.
* Who wrote the first version of the UNIX shell? Ken Thompson
* Who invented the B programming language? Ken Thompson & Dennis Ritchie
* Who is Ken Thompson? An original developer of the Unix Shell
* How does a shell work?
* What is a pid and a ppid?
* Learn how to manipulate the environment of the current process.
* What is the difference between a function and a system call?
* Learn how to create processes.
* How does the shell use the PATH to find the programs?
* Learn how to execute another program with the execve system call.
* Learn how to suspend the execution of a process until one of its children terminates.
* What is EOF / “end-of-file”?

<ul>
<li>What are the three prototypes of main?</li>
<ul>
<li>int main(void)</li>
<li>int main(int ac, char **av)</li>
<li>int main(int ac, char **av, char **env)</li>
</ul>
</ul>


### [0. README](./README.md)

* A README file that describes the simple shell project

### [0. man page](./man_1_simple_shell)

* This file contains the functions utilized in our Shell program

### [0. AUTHORS Acknowledgement](./AUTHORS)

* This file details contacts of the authors of this shell project

### [1. Betty would be proud](./simple_shell)

* A beautiful code that passes the betty checks.

### [2. Simple shell 0.1](./simple_shell)

* Write a UNIX command line interpreter.
<ul>
<li>What should your shell do?</li>
<ul>
<li> Display a prompt and wait for the user to type a command. A command line always ends with a new line.</li>
<li> The prompt is displayed again each time a command has been executed.
<li> The command lines are simple, no semicolons, no pipes, no redirections or any other advanced features.</li>
<li> The command lines are made only of one word. No arguments will be passed to programs.</li>
<li> If an executable cannot be found, print an error message and display the prompt again.</li>
<li>Handle errors</li>
<li>You have to handle the “end of file” condition(Ctrl + D)</li>
</ul>
<li>Test the file in C </li>
</ul>

### [3. Simple shell 0.2](./simple_shell)

* Our 0.1+ shell can handle command lines with arguments

### [4. Simple shell 0.3](./simple_shell)

* Our 0.2+ simple shell can handle the PATH

### [5. Simple shell 0.4](./simple_shell)

* Implement the exit built in that exits the shell 0.3+

### [6. Simple shell 1.0](./simple_shell)

* Implement the shell build in, that prints the current environment

### [Task 7. What happens when you type ls -l in the shell?](./simple_shell)

* Write a blog post describing step by step what happens
<ul>
<li>Blog post should contain the following</li>
<ul>
<li>Have at least one picture, at the top of the blog post</li>
<li>Publish your blog post on Medium or LinkedIn</li>
<li>Share your blog post at least on Twitter and LinkedIn</li>
<li> Only one blog post by team</li>
<li> The blog post must be done and published before the first deadline</li>
<li> Please, remember that these blogs must be written in English to further your technical ability in a variety of settings</li>
</ul>
<li>Remember to add the URLs for blog post and tweet</li>
</ul>
